# PANet: Few-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment

This repo contains code for our ICCV 2019 paper [PANet: Few-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06391).

### Dependencies

* Python 3.6 +
* PyTorch 1.0.1
* torchvision 0.2.1
* NumPy, SciPy, PIL
* pycocotools
* sacred 0.7.5
* tqdm 4.32.2

### Data Preparation for VOC Dataset

1. Download `SegmentationClassAug`, `SegmentationObjectAug`, `ScribbleAugAuto` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N00R9m9qe2rKZChZ8N7Hib_HR2HGtXHp?usp=sharing) and put them under `VOCdevkit/VOC2012`.

2. Download `Segmentation` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N00R9m9qe2rKZChZ8N7Hib_HR2HGtXHp?usp=sharing) and use it to replace `VOCdevkit/VOC2012/ImageSets/Segmentation`.


### Usage

1. Download the ImageNet-pretrained weights of VGG16 network from `torchvision`: [https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg16-397923af.pth](https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg16-397923af.pth) and put it under `PANet/pretrained_model` folder.

2. Change configuration via `config.py`, then train the model using `python train.py` or test the model using `python test.py`. You can use `sacred` features, e.g. `python train.py with gpu_id=2`.
